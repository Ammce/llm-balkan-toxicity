## Overview

This repository provides resources and information related to our study on evaluating large language models (LLMs) for toxic language detection in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian.  
The work introduces a manually labeled dataset of 4,500 YouTube and TikTok comments and benchmarks four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus) in both zero-shot and context-augmented modes.
